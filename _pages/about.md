**I have multiple (2-5) openings for PhD students and visitors at the University of Virginia (UVa).  Send me an email if you are excited about the privacy issues in data science and want to work together!  I have joint appointment with the Department of Computer Science and the School of Data Science so you can apply both programs.**

**I'm on the academic job market.**

I am a post-doc fellow at Carnegie Mellon University, working with Prof. Elaine Shi.  
I'm joining the University of Virginia (UVa) as an assistant professor.
I got my PhD from Purdue University under the supervision of Prof. Ninghui Li.
Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Fudan University, under the supervision of Prof. Yunlei Zhao.
In Fall 2018, I did an intern in Alibaba with Dr. Bolin Ding.
In Summer 2020, I did an intern in Tumult Labs with Prof. Ashwin Machanavajjhala.


I study differential privacy (DP) and local DP (LDP), with a focus on designing algorithms that work in practice. I started my research from designing algorithms for computational geometry problems; then I designed an searchable encryption (SSE) scheme.
