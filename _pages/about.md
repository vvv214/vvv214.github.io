I am a fourth-year PhD student from the Department of Computer Science, Purdue University.
My advisor is Prof. Ninghui Li.
In Fall 2018, I did an intern in Alibaba with Dr. Bolin Ding.
Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Software School, Fudan University, under the supervision of Prof. Yunlei Zhao.


I study differential privacy (DP) and local DP (LDP), with a focus on designing algorithms that work in practice. I started my research from designing algorithms for computational geometry problems; then I designed an searchable encryption (SSE) scheme.

**News** : Going to SIGMOD.
