**I have multiple (2-5) openings for PhD students and visitors at the University of Virginia (UVa).  Send me an email if you are excited about the privacy issues in data science and want to work together!  I have joint appointment with the Department of Computer Science and the School of Data Science so you can apply both programs.**
**I'm on the academic job market.**
**Hiring!** I am actively looking for PhD students and interns.  If you are admitted into the UVa PhD program or if you want to work with me, we should talk!

I got my PhD from Purdue University under the supervision of Prof. Ninghui Li.
Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree from Fudan University, under the supervision of Prof. Yunlei Zhao.
In Fall 2018, I did an intern in Alibaba with Dr. Bolin Ding.

I am an assistant professor at the University of Virginia.  I got my PhD from Purdue University and my Bachelor's degree from Fudan University.  I work on differential privacy and machine learning privacy, focusing on designing algorithms that work in practice.

My lovely wife [Xuejun Zhao](https://xuejunzhao.netlify.app/) is an assistant professor in Information System and Operations Management at UNC Charlotte.

### Personal Projects

[![Chat with DP Advisor](https://img.shields.io/badge/Chat_with-DP_Advisor-blue)](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68a88d81a07c8191bcfaa3beb0337ec2-differential-privacy-advisor) A custom GPT for DP users. <details>This assistant is designed to help users determine if DP is the right tool for their problem and avoid common pitfalls. It's an early-stage project, and feedback on its responses is highly welcome. **The tool does not collect any personal information.** For critical applications involving decision-making, please consult with me or another human expert. The logic and prompts behind it are also available upon request via email.</details>

[![Visit PrivSyn](https://img.shields.io/badge/Visit-PrivSyn-blue)](http://privsyn.com)
A website to walk users over the process of generating a synthetic tabular dataset. <details>This is an early-stage project and has only been tested on the adult dataset. The range and domain categories are inferred from the dataset, which in practice should not be this way, and users are supposed to change that based on their knowledge about the metadata, but I haven't changed that code yet. **I do not collect any information, but users shouldn't upload anything sensitive to that website because the backend is on Google Cloud.** Also, I'm only using a free tier on Google Cloud, so it's very likely that the backend will crash.</details>
