## About Me

I am an assistant professor at the **University of Virginia** with a joint appointment in the Department of Computer Science and the School of Data Science. I received my PhD from **Purdue University** and my Bachelor's degree from **Fudan University**.

My research focuses on **differential privacy** and **machine learning privacy**, with an emphasis on designing algorithms that work in practice.

My lovely wife [Xuejun Zhao](https://xuejunzhao.netlify.app/) is an assistant professor in Information System and Operations Management at UNC Charlotte.
