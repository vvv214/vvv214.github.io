** I will join the University of Virginia (UVa) as an assistant professor!  I have multiple (2-5) openings for PhD students and post-docs.  Send me an email if you are excited about the privacy issues in data science and want to work together!  I have joint appointment with the Department of Computer Science and the School of Data Science so you can apply both programs.**

**I'm on the academic job market.**

I am a sixth-year PhD student from the Department of Computer Science, Purdue University.
My advisor is Prof. Ninghui Li.
In Fall 2018, I did an intern in Alibaba with Dr. Bolin Ding.
In Summer 2020, I did an intern in Tumult Labs with Prof. Ashwin Machanavajjhala.
Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Software School, Fudan University, under the supervision of Prof. Yunlei Zhao.


I study differential privacy (DP) and local DP (LDP), with a focus on designing algorithms that work in practice. I started my research from designing algorithms for computational geometry problems; then I designed an searchable encryption (SSE) scheme.
