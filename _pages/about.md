I am an assistant professor at the University of Virginia.  I got my PhD from Purdue University and my Bachelor's degree from Fudan University.  I work on differential privacy and machine learning privacy, focusing on designing algorithms that work in practice.

My lovely wife [Xuejun Zhao](https://xuejunzhao.netlify.app/) is an assistant professor in Information System and Operations Management at UNC Charlotte.

**Note** I am very happy with the size of my fantastic group of current phd and intern students. I do not plan to take new phd students fall 25 and fall 26.
