**I have multiple (2-5) openings for PhD students and visitors at the University of Virginia (UVa).  Send me an email if you are excited about the privacy issues in data science and want to work together!  I have joint appointment with the Department of Computer Science and the School of Data Science so you can apply both programs.**
**I'm on the academic job market.**
**Hiring!** I am actively looking for PhD students and interns.  If you are admitted into the UVa PhD program or if you want to work with me, we should talk!

I am an assistant professor at the University of Virginia.  I got my PhD from Purdue University and my Bachelor's degree from Fudan University.  I work on differential privacy and machine learning privacy, focusing on designing algorithms that work in practice.

My lovely wife [Xuejun Zhao](https://xuejunzhao.netlify.app/) is an assistant professor in Information System and Operations Management at UNC Charlotte.

**Note** I am very happy with the size of my fantastic group of current phd and intern students. I do not plan to take new phd students fall 25 and fall 26.  
**Note** Due to over commitment to conference program committees, I will not review journal papers. If you need reviews, I highly recommend my students (see Students tab).
