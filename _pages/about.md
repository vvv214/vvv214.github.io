I am a fourth-year PhD student from the Department of Computer Science, Purdue University.
My advisor is Prof. Ninghui Li.
Before that, I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Software School, Fudan University, under the supervision of Prof. Yunlei Zhao.

I am interested in data privacy.  Specifically, I study Differential Privacy and Local Differential Privacy.
