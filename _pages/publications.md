* We have 2 tutorials in SIGMOD'18 and KDD'18 about LDP [Privacy at Scale: Local Differential Privacy in Practice](https://sites.google.com/view/kdd2018-tutorial/home).

* I maintain a list of LDP implementations (by myself and my collaborators) at [LDP_Protocols](https://github.com/vvv214/LDP_Protocols).

* 8 first-author papers in top-tier conferences VLDB'20, NDSS'20, SIGMOD'19, CCS'18 (co-first author), SP'18, Usenix'17, CCS'16 and journal TDSC'19.

* During undergrad, I published 2.x first-author papers in AsiaCCS'16, PloS ONE'15, and SoCG'14 (alphabetical order).

* All papers and code are publicly available. If you find an exception, let me know.
* Also maintained in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TkgyXGwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Tianhao).
