Summary
======
* I have published 3.5+1 first-author papers in top-tier security+database conferences: SIGMOD'19, CCS'18 (co-first author), SP'18, Usenix'17, CCS'16.

* I also like the database community. We have 2 tutorials in SIGMOD'18 and KDD'18 about LDP [Privacy at Scale: Local Differential Privacy in Practice](https://sites.google.com/view/kdd2018-tutorial/home).

* I maintain a list of my LDP papers and implementations [LDP_Protocols](https://github.com/vvv214/LDP_Protocols). 

* During undergrad, I published 2.x first-author papers in AsiaCCS'16, PloS ONE'15, and SoCG'14 (alphabetical order).

* Details are given below (also maintained in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TkgyXGwAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) and [DBLP](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/w/Wang_0001:Tianhao)).
