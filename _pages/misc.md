Personal
======
* I grew up in Zibo, Shandong. At the age of 15, I moved to Shanghai, in which I live for 8 years. During my undergrad, I spent 2 months in Dublin, 4 months in Taiwan, and 2 months in Hong Kong.
* I am curious about new things. 
* I like practical optimization: one is to optimize my daily routines/activities; the other is online optimization (e.g., choosing what to cook and what to buy).
* I prefer to finish trivial things first (e.g., I finished this website).

Interest
======
* Playing sports: I like to participate in fun activities.
  - Enjoy: basketball>hiking>badminton>tennis
  - Do not like: table tennis, workout, running, swimming (I feel boring and painful)
* Cooking
* Watching youtube videos, e.g., movie recaps, gaming videos (of Warcraft 3, to help me sleep) , vlogs, etc.
